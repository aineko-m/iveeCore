This file lists major changes in iveeCore releases.

Version 2.4 - March
--------------------------------
- Removed Team and Speciality classes and related functionality
- Refactored cache design

Version 2.3 - January 20th, 2015
--------------------------------
- Adapted to Proteus release.
- Added Redis caching support (via Predis).
- Added Starbase class, with calculation of fuel consumption.
- I decided not to remove teams yet, as the functionality can still be used to calculate "what-if" scenarios.
- Existing users will have to remake the configuration file based on the new template.

Version 2.2 - December 14th, 2014
---------------------------------
- Adapted to Rhea release.
- Extracted market data from the Type class hierarchy to separate classes, RegionMarketData and GlobalPriceData
(averagePrice and adjustedPrice as returned by the CREST API and needed for industry calculations). This provides better
separation of concerns and removes some inconsistencies for types that inherited from Sellable, but were not actually on
the market. Trying to get the market objects from these types will throw an exception instead.
- Removed Sellable class.
- Split iveeCore tables to their own DB schema, separate from SDE DB. This improves handling of the DB during SDE
upgrades, as the iveeCore tables don't have to be copied, which can potentially become multiple GB in size.
- Refactored base Type classes and caching, the new hierarchy being CacheableCommon <- SdeType <- Type.
- Removed assembly line compatibility hack for blueprints, provided missing database rows instead (data missing in the
SDE since Phoebe).
- Fixed bugs in class loader and EMDR cache invalidation.
- Existing users will have to remake the configuration file based on the new template.

Upcoming changes:
- With the introduction of market data API endpoints to authenticated CREST, it is time to replace EMDR.
- The last industry teams in game will expire on January 22th, so the functionality will then be removed from iveeCore.

Version 2.1 - November 8th, 2014
--------------------------------
- Adapt to Phoebe release
-> Rename REBlueprint to T3Blueprint.
-> Refactor reverse engineering as it has been merged into invention, also changing the class hierarchy for Relic and
T3Blueprint.
-> Adapt invention to changes.
-> The SDE is missing assembly line compatibility data for blueprints, which made a hack necessary to make it still
work. However, the calculated cost of research, copying and invention will not take into account cost bonuses for
assembly lines that have them in-game.
- Existing users will have to remake the configuration file based on the new template.

Version 2.0.1 - October 1st, 2014
---------------------------------
- Adapt to Oceanus release.
- Small bugfixes to CREST updater.

Version 2.0 - September 20th, 2014
----------------------------------

- Major overhaul to adapt to industry changes brought with EvE's Crius expansion
-> CREST data fetchers for system industry indices, teams & specialities, facilities and market prices
-> Refactored all industry activity methods to make use of the new modifiers, removed obsoleted methods
- Namespaces, class autoloading and style changes to make iveeCore a bit more PSR compliant
- Restructured SDE, Type and Cache classes for better separation of concerns
- Added Reverse Engineering classes and calculation
- Made instantiation of iveeCore objects use dynamic class name lookup more consistently
- Removed POS slot fuel cost estimation as it was deemed out of scope for this library and confusing
- Database changes, migration provided
- Existing users will have to remake the configuration file based on the new template

Version 1.4.1 - July 14, 2014
-----------------------------
- Fixed faulty SQL queries in the EMDR client
- Throw exceptions on SQL errors
- Print type and region names in the EMDR client for incoming data

Version 1.4 - July 11, 2014
---------------------------
- Refactored EMDR client: Multi region support, reduce memory usage, avoid id autoincrement inflation
- Replaced SDE->printDbStats() with getStats()
- Replaced DB hack for vol and tx weekly averages, DB schema changed as a result; DB migration provided
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required

Version 1.3.1 - June 8, 2014
----------------------------
- Adapted README, the configuration template and the unit test to Kronos 1.0.
- Added bash script to restart the EMDR client

Version 1.3 - March 29, 2014
----------------------------
- Added parsers for EFT-style and EvE's XML fitting descriptions as well as cargo and ship scanning results.
- Reworked how configuration & defaults and utility methods are organized, for cleaner separation and better
consistency. Defaults now reside in IveeCoreDefaults.php and customization is done in the subclass/file
MyIveeCoreDefaults.php. As a consequence, iveeCoreConfig_template.php also changed a lot, therefore configuration files
will have to be redone.
- Adapted README to Rubicon 1.3 release
- More bugfixes and unit tests

Version 1.2.1 - February 16, 2014
---------------------------------
- Minor changes to include path handling
- Adapted README to Rubicon 1.2 release
- Added iveeCoreConfig.php to .gitignore

Version 1.2 - February 8, 2014
------------------------------
- Added reaction calculations
- Rewrote type materials and requirements handling. This fixed reprocessing calculations and most off-by-1 errors. The
memory use of the type array was reduced by up to 30%. The stored procedure iveeGetRequirements() is obsoleted by this
change, which makes for more maintainable code.
- Bug fixes and more convenience functions.
- Renamed MaterialSet to MaterialMap and SkillSet to SkillMap as it better describes the classes purpose.
- Renamed CopyData to CopyProcessData, InventionData to InventionProcessData and ManufactureData to
ManufactureProcessData for consistency.
- Added some PHPUnit test cases covering different parts of iveeCore.
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required

Version 1.1 - November 10, 2013
-------------------------------
- Added reprocessing calculations for Type objects
- Added volume attribute to Type classes and total volume calculation to process classes
- Moved material requirements from process class to its own MaterialSet class
- Moved skill requirements from process class to its own SkillSet class
- Added custom Exceptions
- More parameter sanity checks
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php and the store procedure iveeGetRequirements() were changed

Version 1.0 - November 2, 2013
------------------------------
- Initial release.
