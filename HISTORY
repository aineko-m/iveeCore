This file lists major changes in iveeCore versions.

Version 2.0 - September 20th, 2014
----------------------------------

- Major overhaul to adapt to industry changes brought with EvE's Crius expansion
-> CREST data fetchers for system industry indices, teams & specialities, facilities and market prices
-> Refactored all industry activity methods to make use of the new modifiers, removed obsoleted methods
- Namespaces, class autoloading and style changes to make iveeCore a bit more PSR compliant
- Restructured SDE, Type and Cache classes for better separation of concerns
- Added Reverse Engineering classes and calculation
- Made instantiation of iveeCore objects use dynamic class name lookup more consistently
- Removed POS slot fuel cost estimation as it was deemed out of scope for this library and confusing
- Database changes, migration provided
- Existing users will have to remake the configuration file based on the new template

Version 1.4.1 - July 14, 2014
-----------------------------
- Fixed faulty SQL queries in the EMDR client
- Throw exceptions on SQL errors
- Print type and region names in the EMDR client for incoming data

Version 1.4 - July 11, 2014
---------------------------
- Refactored EMDR client: Multi region support, reduce memory usage, avoid id autoincrement inflation
- Replaced SDE->printDbStats() with getStats()
- Replaced DB hack for vol and tx weekly averages, DB schema changed as a result; DB migration provided
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required

Version 1.3.1 - June 8, 2014
----------------------------
- Adapted README, the configuration template and the unit test to Kronos 1.0.
- Added bash script to restart the EMDR client

Version 1.3 - March 29, 2014
----------------------------
- Added parsers for EFT-style and EvE's XML fitting descriptions as well as cargo and ship scanning results.
- Reworked how configuration & defaults and utility methods are organized, for cleaner separation and better 
consistency. Defaults now reside in IveeCoreDefaults.php and customization is done in the subclass/file 
MyIveeCoreDefaults.php. As a consequence, iveeCoreConfig_template.php also changed a lot, therefore configuration files 
will have to be redone.
- Adapted README to Rubicon 1.3 release
- More bugfixes and unit tests

Version 1.2.1 - February 16, 2014
---------------------------------
- Minor changes to include path handling
- Adapted README to Rubicon 1.2 release
- Added iveeCoreConfig.php to .gitignore

Version 1.2 - February 8, 2014
------------------------------
- Added reaction calculations
- Rewrote type materials and requirements handling. This fixed reprocessing calculations and most off-by-1 errors. The 
memory use of the type array was reduced by up to 30%. The stored procedure iveeGetRequirements() is obsoleted by this 
change, which makes for more maintainable code.
- Bug fixes and more convenience functions
- Renamed MaterialSet to MaterialMap and SkillSet to SkillMap as it better describes the classes purpose
- Renamed CopyData to CopyProcessData, InventionData to InventionProcessData and ManufactureData to 
ManufactureProcessData for consistency
- Added some PHPUnit test cases covering different parts of iveeCore
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php changed, thus adaptation of the configuration file is required

Version 1.1 - November 10, 2013
-------------------------------
- Added reprocessing calculations for Type objects
- Added volume attribute to Type classes and total volume calculation to process classes
- Moved material requirements from process class to its own MaterialSet class

- Added custom Exceptions
- More parameter sanity checks
- Note that the file iveeCoreConfig_template.php and the store procedure iveeGetRequirements() were changed
